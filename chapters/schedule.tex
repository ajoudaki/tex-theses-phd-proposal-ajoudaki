%% A schedule showing clearly when you started the PhD, the work packages completed or under way and the envisaged start and end times of the future work packages should be included. This should include estimates of when the thesis will be completed, including the writing of the thesis report.
The research schedule for four years is presented in Figure \ref{fig:timeSchedule}.
It comprises the six work packages previously discussed.
